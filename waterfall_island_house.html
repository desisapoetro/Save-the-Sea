		<h1>Save the Sea</h1>
		<p>The ocean is home to millions of species of wildlife, and it's our responsibility to protect it.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Reduce your plastic waste</li>
			<li>Adopt sustainable fishing practices</li>
			<li>Support responsible tourism</li>
			<li>Donate to charities and conservation efforts</li>
			<li>Spread the word to others about the importance of protecting the ocean</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Don't Trash the Sea</h2>
		<p>Plastic pollution is one of the biggest threats to our oceans. Every year, millions of tons of plastic enter the sea – causing serious damage to marine ecosystems and wildlife. Reducing your plastic waste is one of the most important steps you can take to protect the ocean.</p>
		<h2>Support Sustainable Fisheries</h2>
		<p>Overfishing puts immense strain on marine ecosystems, and can lead to the collapse of entire species. Support sustainable fisheries and marine conservation efforts by only eating fish that has been harvested in an ethical and responsible way.</p>
		<h2>Practice Responsible Tourism</h2>
		<p>Tourism can be an incredible way to explore the world's oceans – but it can also have a negative impact. Respect the environment and marine life by following local rules and regulations, and by leaving only footprints and taking only photos.</p>
		<h2>Donate to Charities and Conservation Efforts</h2>
		<p>Donating to charities and conservation efforts is a great way to support the protection of our oceans. There are many organisations working hard to protect the sea, and your donations can go a long way towards ensuring their work is successful.</p>
		<h2>Spread the Word</h2>
		<p>The more people that know the importance of protecting the sea, the better. Spread the word to your friends, family, and social network about the devastating effects of ocean pollution and the importance of protecting the ocean.</p>
